1.5.1 (2012-02-02)
------------------
o Better handling of failed transactions

1.5.M02 (2012-10-10)
--------------------
o Fixed a windows-specific issue for long-running backups in that the active logical log was locked by the backup. Solved by rotating before backup.

1.5.M01

1.4

1.3 GA
------
o Removed dependency on HA. Now it is expected that resolving the master of a ZooKeeper cluster is the responsibility of the HA component, providing it as a @Service.
o Removed the -from-ha argument, since it is not needed
o Switched from explicit backup target implementation specification (ha or simple for the time being) to a URI format.

1.3.M03 (2012-02-25)
--------------------
o Initial release.
